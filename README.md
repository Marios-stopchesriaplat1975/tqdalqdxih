Oh man, just saw The Accountant 2, and walking out of the theater, my head's all fuzzy. It’s like trying to remember a dream you had while your roommate's blender is going off in the background. Ben Affleck, right, he's back, but it's less math genius and more shooting-from-the-hip kind of vibe, if that makes sense. They’ve doubled down on the action, like how much adrenaline can you pump into a person before they turn into a living espresso machine?

Popcorn smushed all over my seat, crazy loud teenagers behind yakkin' non-stop, but somehow it all added to the chaos of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 in a weirdly fitting way. There’s this scene in the middle, hang on, or maybe it was near the end, where he’s doing calculations on bullet trajectories? My brain tried to follow but it’s like trying to solve an algebra question with a hangover. And his brother? More complicated than my taxes last year. Family drama ramped up to 11.

> There's a chase scene that was, wow, it’s like Fast & Furious decided to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 itself into an accountant’s life. Cars flipping over like they're made of Lego bricks and the soundtrack just pounding away like a toddler with pots and pans. I swear I could feel the floor vibrate. Need to get me one of those theater setup rigs at home. Oh, you wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   too? Guess you'll have to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it later, my details are all churned up like a smoothie right now.

The noise, so loud at points, I thought either I'm going deaf or it's an avant-garde sound design choice. Either way, it fits. Somehow, somewhere they tried to tie everything up with a neat bow, but in that mess-of-cables-in-the-closet kind of way. Memory’s slipping, Affleck's face is fading, back’s aching from that horrible seat. Confused but content, like when you accidentally solve a puzzle by sheer randomness.

And if you wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   too, just a heads up: it’s like eating an entire cake in one sitting – exhilarating with a side of regret and confusion. Now the thing is, should I try 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   later to catch all the parts I blinked through? 

Hell, where’d this come from?

```csharp
//Random thing
var dazedThoughts = new Impressions();
dazedThoughts.Add(chaotic action);
dazedThoughts.Add(loud noises);
// fix this later?
